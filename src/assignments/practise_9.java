//    You are designing a class to encapsulate the information about a shop item.
//    A Java Beans component is needed to do this.The Shop class has private instance variables to store the item information:
//
//private int itemPrice;
//private String itemName;
//private String description;

//Which method signature follows the JavaBeans naming standard for modifying the itemPrice instance variable ?

//setItemPrice(int itemPrice)--> answer


//explaination:
// Java bean naming standard is to keep a set before the variable name for modifying it.
//Hence the method setItemPrice(int itemPrice) is the correct naming standard.
